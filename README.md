# Windows11-StartMenu-PSADT

 What I do is I prepare a start-menu on a clean device.
  Go to the folder: C:\Users\YourUSERHERE\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState
  Get the start.bin or start2.bin depending on OS version.
  My script is based on Windows 11 Build 22621
  Copy the .bin file in "FILES" folder of this script
  Edit the Deploy-Application.PS1 to change the .BIN file name
  Download the whole folder, Run the Deploy-application.exe to install the custom Start Menu.
